Aim of these activities: Participants will start to think about who they could share their ideas with, and what change-making they might want to be a part of after this activity.

## Concept: Opportunities to share your thoughts and be involved in change making
**Example activities: Impact brainstorm and workshop** 

The moderator needs to highlight that the group now has a set of privacy principles and specific details that they think (on balance) would make tech more trustworthy.

The moderator needs to discuss with the group which decision-makers might be interested in this, i.e. who is working on legislation or regulations around this, who is developing curriculums, which civil society groups are involved, what conferences are happening, what commercial actors are doing in this space, etc. 

They can then ask the group if they want to share their ideas with these decision-makers to help shape decision-making.

If they do, you need to use this time flexibly to respond to young people’s interest and the opportunities. For example, the group might:
* Draft a letter together now to send to to policy makers or open submissions;
* Write a speech for a talk they can give;
* Write a blog for a civil society group about what privacy looks like;
* If they are going to write up a report about the findings from this session, they might want to write a foreword for it;
* Any other ideas that they may wish to execute in this session

They can break into smaller groups if some young people are interested in different outputs.

Make sure at the end, you have the ability to reconnect with any young person who says they want to stay engaged. The idea is to use these activities as a runway, not a a full-stop. 

**Time taken:** 

60-90min. The longer you have for this, the more you can actually do together as a group. If you’re short on time, you can flag opportunities and invite young people to reconnect and work together after the session if they want.

**Resources needed:** 
Nothing specific, but pens and paper are helpful
