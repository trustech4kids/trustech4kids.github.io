## Concept: Privacy in a digital age – understanding the potential size of your data footprint
**Example activities: Quickfire footprint warm up** 

Ask young people to holla out all the sorts of personal information about them that might be known online that they can think of. 

You might need to start off with some prompts, like “online, is your date of birth anywhere” etc.

Each time someone says something, colour in one part of the foot. The aim is to colour in the foot, and get as creative as you can about the answers.

Prompt young people as they are going: “what about your name, what about your face, bank details, where you are, what about your eye colour – do you reckon online people might know that”, etc.

If you’ve got some sort of ‘prize’ for everyone who says something it helps; also, it sets a culture of “say anything and everything”. The more free flowing and expansive the answers become, the easier the conversation about online privacy becomes later.  In terms of adding this to the ‘giant foot’, be creative if you get more answers than segments. We ended our foot by drawing toenails, or drawing an ankle and a leg. Keep it fun.

Discussion points for the end:
* Is this a lot of data? Does it worry anyone? 
* Would we want everyone to be able to see this information?
* How much data do we think advertisers hold about us, by the time we turn 12? Take a guess,  explain that others have guessed it’s 72 million data points etc

**Time taken** 

Between 10 min if you want to keep it fast, to 30 minutes, if you want depth. Keep in mind, at 30 minutes it might feel quite long and boring, so make sure you’ve got prizes, prompts or have set a fun ambitious target for the group to meet, ready to keep the group going.

**Resources needed** 

Use a drawing of a foot on a white board, or a piece of poster paper with the outline of a foot drawn on it, or a slide deck with a giant foot outline.

The foot needs to be divided into between 5 and 20 segments, to colour in everytime a young person offers an answer.
