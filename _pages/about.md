**Trust Tech 4 Kids** weaves together four global research pilots to explore what young people (10-18yo) think trustworthy tech looks like when it comes to their data and privacy, and explore how these principles could inform development and regulations.

Its objectives include
- Provide principles for technologists and regulators about what 'trustworthy tech' looks like based on empirical studies with kids from four countries
- Provide academic outputs, including documentation of the methods for working across countries and organisations
- Disseminating key outputs of the project at critical public events, such as IEEE's Trustworthy Tech and RightsCon
