excerpt: 'This report draws on a series of workshops and surveys exploring young people's privacy in particular. They were held in December 2022, funded by the Internet Society Foundation. Similar workshops were held in Ghana, Slovenia and Australia across 2022. In this report, we build on this research by including interviews and analysis exploring young people's provisions and participation too. The aim is to contribute to an already thriving discussion about the digital future of Antigua and Barbuda. We hope this report raises interesting and challenging questions, and points to a few potential answers and ideas for solutions too.'
