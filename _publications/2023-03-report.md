excerpt: 'This report draws on a series of workshops and surveys exploring young people's privacy in particular. They were held in December 2022, funded by the Internet Society Foundation. Similar workshops were held in Ghana, Slovenia and Australia across 2022. In this report, we build on this research by including interviews and analysis exploring young people's provisions and participation too. The aim is to contribute to an already thriving discussion about the digital future of Antigua and Barbuda. We hope this report raises interesting and challenging questions, and points to a few potential answers and ideas for solutions too.'

Around 22\% of Antiguans and Barbudans are children under the age of 18, 1 and each of their childhoods will have been defined to some extent by the digital world. As the global experience of the pandemic showed, the reach of the digital world is growing, with everything from education to leisure to extended family life moving partly online. Children are increasingly growing up digitally.

The digital world young Antiguans and Barbudans inhabit is filled with online opportunities and risks that previous generations could have only imagined. Understanding these, and how they shape young people's childhoods and life chances, is critical to ensuring that the next generation is adequately supported to meet the increasingly digital future of Antigua and Barbuda. 

This report tries to explore what some of these opportunities and risks might be, through a child rights lens. Children and young people's rights apply in the digital world equally.

They have rights to provision -- to be able to access and know about the digital world -- to protection—including rights to privacy and online safety—and to participate in and shape their digital future.

This report draws on a series of workshops and surveys exploring young people's privacy in particular. They were held in December 2022, funded by the Internet Society Foundation. Similar workshops were held in Ghana, Slovenia and Australia across 2022. In this report, we build on this research by including interviews and analysis exploring young people's provisions and participation too. The aim is to contribute to an already thriving discussion about the digital future of Antigua and Barbuda. We hope this report raises interesting and challenging questions, and points to a few potential answers and ideas for solutions too.
